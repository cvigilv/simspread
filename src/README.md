This folder contains all the scripts needed to run and evaluate the predictive performance of the proposed and baseline methods.
The directory has the following convention:

- `src/predict` contains the Julia scripts needed to predict protein-ligand interactions in the 3 cross-validation schemes used in the study
- `src/evaluate` contains the Python scripts used to evaluate the predictions obtained from `src/predict`
- `src/modules` contains code packages needed to run the prediction scripts
